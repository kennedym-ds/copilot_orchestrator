## Purpose
Use this checklist whenever the Copilot Reviewer (or any specialist persona) evaluates a pull request. It codifies how to interpret plans, diffs, tests, and compliance requirements while keeping the conductor-led workflow intact.

## Review Workflow
1. **Baseline Context**
   - Confirm the related plan or issue link is present and matches the scope.
   - Load 16 lines of context around each touched file to understand integration impacts.
   - Pin any essential context in memory so follow-up subagents inherit the latest decisions.

2. **Severity-Focused Analysis**
   - Tag findings with `[BLOCKER]`, `[MAJOR]`, `[MINOR]`, or `[NIT]`.
   - Align severity with risk: security/privacy > data loss > regression > maintainability.

3. **Evidence Collection**
   - Demand a test matrix that lists command, environment, and result.
   - Verify lint, smoke, and token-report outputs are attached for instruction/prompt changes.
   - Note missing coverage and recommend concrete test additions.

4. **Specialist Escalations**
   - Include the exact `#runSubagent {persona}` command when additional review is required, e.g.:
     - `#runSubagent security` for auth, secrets, or compliance concerns.
     - `#runSubagent performance` for throughput, latency, or resource warnings.
     - `#runSubagent visualizer` when UX/accessibility gaps appear.
     - `#runSubagent data-analytics` for metrics, dashboards, or data quality issues.

5. **Verdict & Next Actions**
   - Conclude with: `APPROVED`, `NEEDS_REVISION`, or `FAILED`.
   - Summarize strengths, issues, and required follow-ups.
   - Direct the conductor to hand off implementation work using the provided `#runSubagent` commands.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Scope and objectives match the approved plan phase.
- [ ] Tests (unit/integration/smoke) were executed with results documented.
- [ ] Documentation and changelog updates are included when instructions or prompts change.
- [ ] Security/privacy implications reviewed; escalated via `#runSubagent security` if needed.
- [ ] Performance impacts assessed; escalated via `#runSubagent performance` if risks exist.
- [ ] UX/accessibility considerations inspected; escalated via `#runSubagent visualizer` when gaps remain.
- [ ] Data quality and analytics verified; escalated via `#runSubagent data-analytics` when required.
- [ ] Residual risks, TODOs, and owners captured for the conductor.

## Review Output Template
```
## Status
APPROVED | NEEDS_REVISION | FAILED

## Summary
- TL;DR outcome with scope confirmation

## Strengths
- Highlight what went well

## Issues
- [SEVERITY] File:Line 11 Issue description
- Remediation guidance or reference to documentation

## Validation
- Command — Result — Notes

## Follow-up
- `#runSubagent implementer` — Address BLOCKER findings 1 & 2
- `#runSubagent security` — Validate new OAuth scope handling
- Risks / Decisions / Approvals outstanding
```

## Best Practices
- Reference authoritative sources (policies, docs, incidents) when justifying findings.
- Encourage incremental fixes; avoid expanding scope without conductor approval.
- Reset or annotate memory entries after review completion to prevent contamination of future tasks.

## When to Pause
- Ambiguous product requirements without plan updates.
- Missing validation evidence for high-risk areas.
- Conflicting guidance between personas—signal the conductor to reconcile.

## Handoff Reminder
Always close with the recommended `#runSubagent` commands so the conductor can delegate fixes, specialist reviews, or documentation updates without retyping instructions.
