# Compliance Overlay

- Ensure all sensitive operations are tracked with ticket IDs or approval references.
- For features touching personal data, require a privacy impact assessment before implementation.
- Document logging, monitoring, and rollback plans in phase summaries.
- Escalate to the security team if proposed changes modify authentication, authorization, or data retention flows.
- When unsure about compliance implications, pause and request human guidance before proceeding.
